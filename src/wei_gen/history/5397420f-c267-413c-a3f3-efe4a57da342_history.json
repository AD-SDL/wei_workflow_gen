To make the PCR liquid preparation, you will need to aliquot the different components into the empty tube provided before transferring the PCR mix to the final plate for the PCR run.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan for preparing the PCR mix and transferring it to the final plate:\n#####\n1. Label the empty tube for storing the PCR mix.\n2. Add the following components to the empty tube to make the PCR mix:\n   - 5x Reaction Buffer: ~1mL\n   - DNA Polymerase: ~40ul\n   - DNTPs: ~200 uL\n   - GC Enhancer: ~1mL\n   - Biowater: 10 mL\n3. Mix the components in the tube thoroughly by gentle inversion.\n4. Prepare the PCR plate by adding the following components to each well:\n   - Forward Primers: ~20ul\n   - Reverse Primers: ~20ul\n   - Template DNA strands: ~20ul\n5. Seal the plate to prevent contamination.\n6. Place the plate with the PCR mix in the thermocycler and run the following cycling conditions:\n   - Denaturation: 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds\n   - Annealing: 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds\n   - Extension: 72\u00b0C for 1 minute\n   - Repeat the cycle for a total of 3 cycles.\n7. After the PCR amplification is complete, seal the plate and incubate at 175\u00b0C for 20 minutes.\n8. Allow the plate to cool before analyzing the PCR products.\n\nThis plan should help you set up and run your PCR experiment effectively.
