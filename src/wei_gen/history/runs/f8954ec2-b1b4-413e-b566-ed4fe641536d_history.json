To proceed with the experiment, you will need to prepare the PCR master mix, aliquot the master mix into the final plate, add the primers and template DNA strands, seal the plate, and run the PCR machine with the designated thermocycling cycles. Here is a step-by-step plan for your PCR experiment:\n\n1. Prepare the PCR master mix by combining the following components in the empty tube:\n   - 10 mL of Biowater\n   - Approximately 1 mL of 5x Reaction Buffer\n   - Approximately 40 \u03bcl of DNA Polymerase\n   - Approximately 200 \u03bcl of DNTPs\n   - Approximately 1 mL of GC Enhancer\n   Mix the components thoroughly by gentle pipetting or vortexing.\n\n2. Aliquot the PCR master mix into the final plate. You can distribute the master mix evenly across the wells in the plate.\n\n3. Add 20 \u03bcl of Forward Primers, 20 \u03bcl of Reverse Primers, and 20 \u03bcl of Template DNA Strands to each well of the final plate.\n\n4. Seal the final plate to prevent evaporation and contamination during PCR amplification. Ensure the seal is tight to maintain the integrity of the reaction.\n\n5. Place the sealed plate in the PCR machine and run the PCR program with 3 thermocycling cycles according to the specific protocol provided. Set the thermocycler to the designated temperature profile for the PCR reaction.\n\n6. After the PCR cycles are completed, remove the final plate from the PCR machine and proceed with further analysis or storage of the amplified DNA samples.\n\n#####",
