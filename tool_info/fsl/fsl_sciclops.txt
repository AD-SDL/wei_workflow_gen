Task: 
Use sciclops tool to get the PCR plate from the stacks in tower2

Previous attempt: 
- name: Sciclops gets plate from stacks
- module: sciclops
- action: run_rxn
- args: 
   - loc: "tower2"

Execution error: 
invalid <action>: <run_rxn> is not a valid <action>

Critique: 
yaml output does not corresponding to the guidelines for the tool, because run_rxn is an invalid action. 

Here's an example output: 
Explain: 
Based on the execution error and critique, run_rxn is not a valid action. Given our task to get the plate from tower2, we need to use get_plate

Output: 
- name: Sciclops gets plate from stacks
- module: sciclops 
- action: get_plate 
- args: 
   - loc: "tower2"
